 Easy to integrate modal. You just need to integrate jquery, GeneralModal.js and GeneralModal.css. No Actual html code to be added besides this.
 Right now, only one such pop-up can be shown on screen (i.e. if you call another popup while this is already on screen, it will replace the previous modal), but this can be changed if needed.

USAGE
===
 just call from anywhere in js:
 ```javascript
 generalModal.show("your title", "your content");
  ```

To be added: ok/cancel buttons and callbacks
